I recently went to an event discussing homelessness. This has been a problem I have been thinking about for a long time, but never thought I could do anything about it. After attending this event, I realized there are so many organizations in Austin that are trying to help and making progress, but how much? 

I know this is a mulifaceted issue that takes more than one person or one organization to solve, but maybe it's something multiple people and multiple organizations can solve together.
